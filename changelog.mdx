<Update label="1st Jan 2025">
  ## Addition of Join DM Module & Music Activty
  - Added `joindm` command group/module
  - `joindm toggle` - Enable or disable join dms in the guild
  - `joindm message` - Set the join dm message for the guild, whether its an embed or just normal content (accepts variables)
  - `joindm test` - Get a DM with the message you've set
  - `joindm view` - View the message script
  - `joindm queue` - This is used to check if there is any current queue, due to ratelimits and large joinings at once, the bot will handle specific amount of joins per minute in a queue system, meaning some dms might be slightly delayed (if there is a mass join)
- **RPC/Status Activities are finally in evict! :tada: :confetti_ball: **
  - You can now directly play music with **evict**
  - Once playing, you will be prompted and asked whether you would like to enable the activity or not
  - If enabled, you will get the current playing song on your status.
  - **Check my attatched image/current status for the example of it**

  ## Avatar History & Commands Revamp
  - We have implemented `avatarhistory` system into the bot
  - This is a **opt-in** only system, meaning by default it will **NOT** be enabled, you have to enable it by running `;avh on` and disable by `;avh off`
  - You can check your avatar history by running `;avh` or by going to the website, for example: https://evict.bot/avatars/930383131863842816 (attached example).
  - You can completely clear your avatarhistory by running `avh clear`, this will result in your avatars being completely deleted from our cdn and database.
- Revamped the commands page https://evict.bot/commands, next up will be the homepage.
- You can now purchase instances & donate with Crypto payments, read more in #mail (make sure to open a ticket)

<Update label="29th Dec 2024">
  ## Brand new voicemaster system & Application commands
  - We have completely reworked the `voicemaster` system to be more configurable at **no cost**, here's what we've done:
  - `voicemaster layout (default/dropdown)`: This command gives you two options, `default` which is the current one, and `dropdown` (attatched example). You will first have to `voicemaster reset` then set the layout then setup. 
  - `voicemaster embed <set/delete/view/variables>`: A group of commands under voicemaster embed which set a embed, removes it, views it and checks the variables that are usable in the embed such as `{lock}` which would show the current set emoji for `lock`.
- You can now use `voicemaster emoji` group of commands to create **custom emojis** on your voicemaster interface! :tada: :confetti_ball: 
  - `voicemaster emoji set (type) (emoji)` - Set a custom emoji for a voicemaster button, to check types run `voicemaster embed variables`
  - `voicemaster emoji remove (type)` - Remove a custom emoji for a voicemaster button
  - `voicemaster emoji reset` - Reset all custom emojis to defaults
  - `voicemaster emoji list` - List all custom emojis for voicemaster buttons
- You can now use the following application commands in DMs:
  - `/google reverse`, `/google search`, `/google youtube`, `/google translate`, `/chatgpt`, `/tts`, a lot of `/actions` commands & a lot of `/media` commands

Remember, before running any of these commands you should first run `voicemaster reset` if you have an existing voicemaster setup.

<Update label="22nd Dec 2024">
  ## Addition of Instances, Donations & new AI commands
Hello everyone, yet another update, this time we've focused more on our other services (and improved them) rather than creating a bunch of new commands. A request that we've gotten for a few weeks now was Instances and Donator perks, and they're now here.

- Brand new AI Commands (limits depends on whether you are a donator or not)
  - `tts` - Convert text to speech using OpenAI's TTS API. Premium (donators) users get 15 uses per hour and HD quality.
  - `imagine` - Generate images using DALL-E 2. Premium users get $15 worth of credits per 2 weeks. Free users get 2 generations per day. (this will be moved to DALL-E 3 soon after some tests)
  - `complete` - Complete your text using GPT-3.5
  - `credits` - Check your DALL-E & other AI services from evict credits.
- Donator perks (automatically applied as soon as payment is completed)
  - $15 worth of DALL-E & OpenAI credits every 2 weeks & more image size options
  - Higher quality image generation options
  - Access to reskin features, less ratelimits & increased income
  - Priority support in our Discord server
  - .. and much more (run `;donate`)
- Instances: An instance is your own version of Evict where you can customize the username, description, status and everything else. This includes access to all 844 commands and features.
  - Access to over 844 commands
  - Custom name, avatar, description & status
  - ... and more (check https://evict.bot/purchase â€” check #purchase **price has been changed from $15 -> $17.5**)

Instances are on a self-service basis, as soon as payment of instances & hosting is completed, you will receive a DM (similar to the one attached) on how to proceed.

<Update label="18th Dec 2024">
  ## Lastfm login via the Web & Spotify login Beta
  We have implemented a new login system for Lastfm which will provide us with more data, eventually we will utilise this data across many commands. The main reason for using Lastfm via the website however is so that we can add a layer of authentication, where basically you cannot use any other user's account and display fake stats on a specific artist and so on. To login, simply run **`;lastfm set`** and it will provide you with an interactive UI to head to the website and login.

We have also added Spotify (beta) playback, and player with over 15 commands. However, this is not publically available **YET** as we require further approval from Spotify, if you would like to test this feature, you can **open a ticket** and provide us with the email of the spotify account you would like to connect and we'll add you to the application testers on Spotify. (We are only giving this chance to 15 members).

- You can check all the `spotify` commands by running **`;help spotify`**
- We have also fixed some bugs, and added about 4-5 flags in the `autoresponse` command
