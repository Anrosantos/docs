# Activity Integration

Evict's Activity integration allows you to showcase your currently playing music directly in your Discord status. This feature seamlessly connects with Evict Music to display real-time music information to other Discord users.

## Features

- Real-time music status updates
- Displays current song title and artist
- Automatic status synchronization
- Support for multiple music platforms

## How It Works

When enabled, the Activity integration monitors your Evict Music playback and automatically updates your Discord status to reflect the current track. Your status will update whenever:

- A new song starts playing
- You pause or resume playback
- You stop playing music

## Display Format

Your Discord status will show:
ðŸŽµ Listening to [Song Name] by [Artist]
